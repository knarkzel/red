# red

`red` is an editor based on vim written in Rust. Goal of this project is to
provide a basic command-line editor, much like nano. Targeted for Redox.
Project is currently abandoned. I wrote this a long time ago as well, so expect
the code to be messy.

To install, run the following command:

```rust
cargo install --git https://github.com/knarkzel/red
```
